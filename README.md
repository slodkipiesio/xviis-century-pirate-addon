# XVII's century pirate mod (or addon for valkyrien skies and eureka)

*(this mod is firstly: W.I.P, secondly: splitted in two parts, one, that doesnt require valkyrien skies and eureka, and one thet does, i would consider using the valkyrien skies version as it will be better)*

this is just a little tiny mod
[W.I.P]

If you want to help me, feel free to contact me on discord: 'slodki_piesek'

If you want to add this mod to a modpack, add it, just tell peeps out there that I (me) made it

List of stuffs i want to add:

-cannons and cannonballs

-pirate captain mob (retextured illager with a hat and a different weapon) and dead pirate captain mob(retextured drowned with a hat and a different weapon) -pirate crew

-boats that spawn on the ocean (if using the valkyrien skies version, they will have a ship helm), there will be 4 types of boats:

Good, with Villagetrs and a vandering trader as a captain

Bad, with Illagers and a pirate captain as a captain

Pillaged boats, broken boats with 2-4 villagers on board and 1 chest

Updated wrecked boats, the vanilla wrecked boats will have an additionall dead pirate captain and a bigger spawn rate of drowned zombies

-killer fish (killer fish from san diego)

i think thats all for now, maybe i'll add something later, who knows
