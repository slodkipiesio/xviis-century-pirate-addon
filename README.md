# XVII's century pirate mod (or addon for valkyrien skies and eureka)

*(this mod is firstly: W.I.P, secondly: splitted in two parts, one, that doesnt require valkyrien skies and eureka, and one thet does, i would consider using the valkyrien skies version as it will be better)*

this is just a little tiny mod
[W.I.P]
